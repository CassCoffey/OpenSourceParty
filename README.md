OpenSourceParty
===============
The aim of this project is to create a unified minigame platform, akin to Mario Party. Users will be able to create minigames using documentation provided here, and the program will be able to load them and play them. The program will have a "select a minigame" mode, and a "party game" mode. The "select a mingame" mode will simply allow the user to choose a game out of their collection of minigames. "Party game" mode will have four players competeing to finish a board game, playing minigames after each turn.
